# Fintech-projects-and-research

My portfolio comprises a collection of research and hands-on projects spanning prominent domains within the fintech landscape. These areas encompass blockchain, financial markets, cybersecurity, business finance and decision-making, artificial intelligence, and financial engineering. Notably, my Master's thesis is an integral component of this portfolio. In this thesis, I conducted a comprehensive comparative analysis of machine learning techniques for stock price prediction, utilizing Python programming. The study was structured around four key objectives: firstly, conducting an exhaustive literature review, with a particular focus on supervised machine learning methods, including LSTM, SVM, Random Forest, and Linear Regression. Secondly, I implemented a diverse range of machine learning models. Thirdly, I evaluated the efficacy of these models through the application of established metrics such as MAPE, MSE, RMSE, and Cross Validation. Lastly, I performed a sensitivity analysis across diverse market conditions, encompassing both bullish and bearish markets, to explore the potential impact of market dynamics on the performance of these machine learning techniques.
